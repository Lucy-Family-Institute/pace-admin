# Ingest // PACE Admin

## Unit Tests

Before you get started, you will need a copy of `.env` with credentials; These belong in the root directory of the repository.

From the PACE Admin root directory:

1. `cd /path/to/pace-admin`
2. `make start_docker`
3. `cd ./ingest`
4. `yarn test`

You should see something like:

```sh
